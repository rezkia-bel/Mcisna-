# Mcisna-
This project is the culmination of my second-year preparatory class in a multidisciplinary setting, where I had the opportunity to create a website for the local town hall Mcisna using  PHP, HTML, CSS,JS and Bootstrap. It serves as a digital platform to provide information and services to the residents and stakeholders of our local municipality.
